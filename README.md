AirPointer — Hand Gesture Controlled Mouse

AirPointer is a touchless, gesture-based mouse controller that allows you to navigate your computer using natural hand movements in mid-air. Powered by real-time computer vision, AirPointer replaces traditional mouse input with intuitive hand tracking for cursor movement, clicks, and basic navigation.

🎯 Key Features
Touchless Mouse Control — Move the cursor using your hand.
Gesture Actions — Click, select, and interact through gestures.
Works With a Standard Webcam — No special hardware required.
Fast & Responsive — Real-time tracking for smooth interaction.
Accessible & Futuristic — Designed for touchless computing, demos, and research.

🧰 How It Works
AirPointer uses hand tracking and landmark detection to interpret gestures such as pointing, pinching, and waving. These gestures are then mapped to mouse events like movement, left click, right click, and drag.

💡 Use Cases
Hands-free computing
Accessibility and assistive technology
Gesture control demos
Computer vision research
Experimental UI interactions
Presentation control

📦 Requirements
Standard webcam
Compatible computer (Windows / macOS / Linux)
(Optional) Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe stack (if using developer build)

🚀 Vision
AirPointer explores the future of human-computer interaction — where devices respond to motion and intent instead of being physically touched. It aims to demonstrate how gesture control can become a mainstream interface for productivity, creativity, and accessibility.
